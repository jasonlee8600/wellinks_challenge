Wellinks Internship Coding Challenge

Your task is to parse data from two different sources, combine those data, and display some of it on screen.

In the data directory you will find two files: erp_users.csv and users.json.

In the language of your choice, write a program that will extract the data from these files (without modifying them) and output the combined result in alphabetical order by last name, then first name, in the following format:

Smith, Robert, rsmith@example.com, 1201 Maple Ave., Hartford, Connecticut 06103

In other words:

{lastname}, {firstname}, {email}, {street number} {street name}, {city}, {state} {zip code}
